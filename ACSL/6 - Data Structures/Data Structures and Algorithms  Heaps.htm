<p>

Heaps are based on the notion of a 
<font color="#fa0000"><b>complete tree</b></font>,
for which we gave an informal definition earlier.
</p><p>
Formally:
</p><p>
A binary tree is 
<font color="#fa0000"><b>completely full</b></font>
if it is of
height, <i>h</i>, and has 2<sup><i>h</i>+1</sup>-1 nodes.
</p><p>
<a name="complete_tree">
A binary tree of height, <i>h</i>, is 
<font color="#fa0000"><b>complete</b></font> <i>iff</i>
</a></p><ol type="a"><a name="complete_tree">
<li> it is empty <i>or</i>
</li><li> its left subtree is complete of height <i>h</i>-1 and its
right subtree is completely full of height <i>h</i>-2 <i>or</i>
</li><li> its left subtree is completely full of height <i>h</i>-1 and its
right subtree is complete of height <i>h</i>-1.
</li></a></ol><a name="complete_tree">
A complete tree is filled from the left:
<ul>
<li> all the leaves are on
<ul>
<li> the same level <i>or</i>
</li><li> two adjacent ones <i>and</i>
</li></ul>
</li><li> all nodes at the lowest level are as far to the left
as possible.
</li></ul>

<h3>Heaps</h3>

A binary tree has the 
<font color="#fa0000"><b>heap property</b></font> <i>iff</i>
<ol type="a">
<li> it is empty <i>or</i>
</li><li> the key in the root is larger than that in either
child and both subtrees have the heap property.
</li></ol>
A heap can be used as a priority
queue: the highest priority item is at the root and is trivially
extracted.
But if the root is deleted, we are left with two sub-trees
and we must <i>efficiently</i>
re-create a single tree with the heap property.
<blockquote>
The value of the heap structure is that we can both extract
the highest priority item and insert a new one in <b>O(log<i>n</i>)</b>
time.
</blockquote>
<p>
How do we do this?
</p><p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>Let's start with this heap.
<p>
A deletion will remove the T<br>
at the root.
</p></td>
<td><img src="./Data Structures and Algorithms  Heaps_files/heap.gif"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
To work out how we're going to maintain the heap property,
use the fact that a complete tree is filled from the left.
So that the position which must become empty is the one
occupied by the M.
<p>
Put it in the vacant root position.
</p></td>
<td><img src="./Data Structures and Algorithms  Heaps_files/heap1.gif"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
This has violated the condition that the
root must be greater than each of its 
children.
<p>
So interchange the M with the larger
of its children.
</p><p>
</p></td>
<td><img src="./Data Structures and Algorithms  Heaps_files/heap2.gif"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
The left subtree has now lost the
heap property.
<p>
So again interchange the M with the larger
of its children.
</p><p>
</p></td>
<td><img src="./Data Structures and Algorithms  Heaps_files/heap3.gif"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>
This tree is now a heap again, so we're finished.
</p><p>
We need to make at most <i>h</i> interchanges of a
root of a subtree with one of its children to
fully restore the heap property.
Thus deletion from a heap is <b>O(<i>h</i>)</b> 
or <b>O(log<i>n</i>)</b>.

</p><h3>Addition to a heap</h3>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
To add an item to a heap, we follow the reverse
procedure.
<p>
Place it in the next leaf position and
move it <b>up</b>.
</p><p>
Again, we require <b>O(<i>h</i>)</b> 
or <b>O(log<i>n</i>)</b>
exchanges.
</p></td>
<td><img src="./Data Structures and Algorithms  Heaps_files/heap4.gif"></td></tr>
</tbody></table>

<h3>Storage of complete trees</h3>
The properties of a complete tree lead to a very efficient
storage mechanism using <i>n</i> sequential locations in an
array.
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td><img src="./Data Structures and Algorithms  Heaps_files/heap5.gif"></td>
<td>
If we number the nodes from 1 at the root and
place:
<ul>
<li>the left child of node <i>k</i> at position 2<i>k</i>
</li><li>the right child of node <i>k</i> at position 2<i>k</i>+1
</li></ul>
<p>
Then the 'fill from the left' nature of the complete 
tree ensures that the heap can be stored in
consecutive locations in an array.
</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
Viewed as an array, we can see that the <i>n</i>th
node is always in index position <i>n</i>.
</td>
<td><img src="./Data Structures and Algorithms  Heaps_files/heap6.gif"></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>
The code for extracting the highest priority item from a 
heap is, naturally, recursive. Once we've extracted the
root (highest priority) item and swapped the last item
into its place, we simply call <tt><font color="green">MoveDown</font></tt> recursively
until we get to the bottom of the tree.

here to load heap_delete.c</a>
</p><p>
Note the macros <tt><font color="green">LEFT</font></tt>
and <tt><font color="green">RIGHT</font></tt> which simply encode
the relation between the index of a node and its left
and right children.
Similarly the <tt><font color="green">EMPTY</font></tt> macro encodes
the rule for determining whether a sub-tree is empty or not.
</p><p>
Inserting into a heap follows a similar strategy,
except that we use a <tt><font color="green">MoveUp</font></tt> function to 
move the newly added item to its correct place.
(For the <tt><font color="green">MoveUp</font></tt> function,
a further macro which defines the
<tt><font color="green">PARENT</font></tt> of a node would normally be added.)

</p><p>
Heaps provide us with a method of sorting,
known as <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/software/AlgAnim/heapsort.html">heapsort</a>.
However, we will examine and analyse the simplest
method of sorting first.

In the animation, note that both the array representation (used in
the implementation of the algorithm) and the (logical) tree representation
are shown. 
This is to demonstrate how the tree is restructured to make a heap again
after every insertion or deletion.
